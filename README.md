# Compressed_HyperFL

This is a simplified implementation of the paper - `https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07187` (HyperFL). The original implementation can be found here - `https://github.com/Pengxin-Guo/HyperFL`.

We aim to enhance HyperFL by
applying compression techniques such as quantization and sparsification, reducing communication costs while maintaining accuracy
and resistance to privacy attacks.
